        It started its activity in the manufacture of machines and then moved to the manufacture of cars, to display its first cars in the Japanese market in 1931. The company manufactured weapons used for military purposes throughout World War II. The company did not adopt the name “Mazda” as a brand for its cars until 1984. Mazda changed its car logo four times before choosing its current design in the market, designed in 1997, which represents the first letter of the company’s name (M) drawn in an aesthetic way resembling two hands extended and raised to the sky looking to the future, with an implicit reference to the religious dimension of the name Mazda. Some call Mazda’s design the owl logo because of its resemblance to an owl’s face.
