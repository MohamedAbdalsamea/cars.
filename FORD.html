     <h4 class="nnnn">Ford Motor Company is an American multinational automobile manufacturing company. It was founded by Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan, USA, and the company's headquarters are still in that city.

        Ford is considered one of the companies specialized in producing cars, and now, after the revolution of economic blocs, it has been annexed to Ford and other companies have merged with it, and Ford has become concerned with the production, development and design of Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercury, Aston Martin, Lincoln and the Volvo car sector. In 2005, Ford's income reached one hundred and seventy-eight billion dollars, which is certainly a huge and large number. Ford is headed by William Ford, the grandson of the founder Henry Ford, and his deputy Joseph Heinrichs. There are many engineers, experts and designers in the company with competence and experience who have brought it to what it is now.
        
        In 1896, Henry Ford built a small vehicle called the Quadricycle, which had four wheels. At first, its wheels were arranged in a specific shape and varied in size. Then the design developed and all the wheels became the same size, and the appropriate alternative was the rectangular shape.</h4>
