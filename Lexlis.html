     <h4 class="nnnn">In 1983, Toyota President Eiji Toyoda held a meeting with the company’s executives. In this meeting, which was described as strictly confidential, the director asked this question.“Can Toyota build a luxury car that competes with the best cars in the world?” This question was the beginning of the secret project that Toyota called the F1 Project. This project made the Lexus LS 400 its target, seeking to design a luxury car to expand Toyota’s production line and increase its car models in preparation for increasing its presence and investments in the local and global market.</h4>
     <h4 class="nnnn">Honda's launch of the Acura car from within the United States of America three years ago encouraged Toyota to pursue the accelerating ranks of luxury cars. At about the same time, Nissan was about to launch its own luxury car brand (Infiniti), and Mazda was also preparing to develop a model of luxury cars that it later called “Amati.”</h4>
