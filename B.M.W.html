     <H4 class="nnnn">The company was founded in 1916 and was headquartered in Munich, Bavaria. But the real origins of establishing the company's name go back to the year 1880, when it was the company financing the German Air Force at that time. Karl and Gustavo Otto are considered the first founders of this company. The company began manufacturing aircraft engines in the first years of its founding, and in 1928 it began manufacturing cars, on March 7. Karl Rapp created the company in partnership with Franz Poppe and the wealthy banker Camillo Castiglione.</H4>
     <h4 class="nnnn">BMW did not start out as an automobile manufacturer, as it was manufacturing aircraft engines for the German Air Force under the name Raab Motorenwerk after the merger of the two companies Raab Motors with Motor Work. However, after Germany lost World War I, a ban was imposed on the manufacture of military aircraft and their engines in Germany. Because of the Treaty of Versailles, the company began manufacturing motorcycles and then decided to enter the world of automobile manufacturing with its first car, the BMW 315.</h4>
